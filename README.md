**Game Page**

The game page is a memory game that challenges the player to match pairs of animal cards. The difficulty can be adjusted to determine the number of cards on the screen, with up to 24 cards possible. At the start of each level, the cards are all face up for a few seconds, giving the player a chance to remember their location. Once the time is up, the cards are flipped back over, and the player must use their memory to match pairs by selecting two cards at a time. The player's remaining lives are displayed at the top of the screen, adding an element of risk to the game as incorrect guesses result in a loss of lives. The colorful backs of the cards and various animal images on the front make for an engaging and fun gameplay experience.
