# Pick N Match

Welcome to "Pick N Match"! This memory matching game is designed to test and improve your ability to remember and recall information. In this game, you'll be presented with a set of cards that contain different animal pictures. Your goal is to find pairs of matching animal cards by flipping them over two at a time. Each player starts with 6 lives. If you make a match, you gain a life, but if no match is made, you lose a life. The game ends when all matches have been found, or when you run out of lives. If you find all the matching pairs before losing all 6 lives, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.

"Pick N Match" also features an "excellent" soundtrack to enhance your gaming experience. "Pick N Match" is a great way to challenge your memory skills, have fun, and enjoy some "great" tunes (just one tune) at the same time. Let's see how good your memory really is!

**Game Page**

The game page is a memory game that challenges the player to match pairs of animal cards. The difficulty can be adjusted to determine the number of cards on the screen, with up to 24 cards possible. At the start of each level, the cards are all face up for a few seconds, giving the player a chance to remember their location. Once the time is up, the cards are flipped back over, and the player must use their memory to match pairs by selecting two cards at a time. The player's remaining lives are displayed at the top of the screen, adding an element of risk to the game as incorrect guesses result in a loss of lives. The colorful backs of the cards and various animal images on the front make for an engaging and fun gameplay experience.
