# Pick N Match

Welcome to "Pick N Match"! This memory matching game is designed to test and improve your ability to remember and recall information. In this game, you'll be presented with a set of cards that contain different animal pictures. Your goal is to find pairs of matching animal cards by flipping them over two at a time. Each player starts with 6 lives. If you make a match, you gain a life, but if no match is made, you lose a life. The game ends when all matches have been found, or when you run out of lives. If you find all the matching pairs before losing all 6 lives, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.

"Pick N Match" also features an "excellent" soundtrack to enhance your gaming experience. "Pick N Match" is a great way to challenge your memory skills, have fun, and enjoy some "great" tunes (just one tune) at the same time. Let's see how good your memory really is!
