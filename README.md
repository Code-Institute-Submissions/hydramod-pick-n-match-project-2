# Pick N Match

Welcome to "Pick N Match"! This memory matching game is designed to test and improve your ability to remember and recall information. In this game, you'll be presented with a set of cards that contain different animal pictures. Your goal is to find pairs of matching animal cards by flipping them over two at a time.

"Pick N Match" offers three difficulty levels - easy, medium and hard - each with a different number of lives.

2. Right-click and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools.
3. Change the view to "responsive" and decrease the width to 320px.
4. Set the zoom to 50%.
5. Increase the width of the responsive window to its maximum.

Expected Result:
- The website should be responsive on all screen sizes, with no stretched or pixelated images.
- There should be no horizontal scrolling.
- No elements should overlap.

Actual Result:
- The website performed as expected.

**Accessability**

The website was tested using the [Wave Accessability Toolt](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool to make sure it met certain accessibility standards.

Color contrasts met the minimum requirements set by the WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines, and the headings were in the correct order to properly convey the importance of the content. All the content was organized into sections, so it was easy to navigate with assistive technology. Any non-text content had descriptive text or titles, and the HTML page language was set correctly. The website was also checked to make sure that the Aria properties were used correctly and that it followed the best coding practices for WCAG 2.1.

# Deployment

The website was built using Visual Studio code and the code was stored on a remote repository on GitHub called "pick-n-match-project-2". To make sure the code was properly stored, git commands were used: "git add" was used to add the files to be committed, "git commit" was used to commit the changes to the local repository, and "git push" was used to push the committed code to the remote repository on GitHub. The website was then deployed to GitHub Pages by navigating to the repository's settings, selecting the "Pages" option, choosing the "main" branch as the source, and clicking "Save". The live link to the site can be found at https://hydramod.github.io/pick-n-match-project-2/. To use the code locally, one can clone the repository from GitHub by copying the HTTPS link, opening an IDE with git installed, and typing "git clone [copied link]" into the terminal.
